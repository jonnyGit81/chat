// We can use select statements whenever we need to synchronize or modify shared memory,
// or take different actions depending on the various activities within our channels.
/*
The preceding code will keep watching the three channels inside our room: join,
leave, and forward. If a message is received on any of those channels,
the select statement will run the code for that particular case.
It is important to remember that it will only run one block of case code at a time.
This is how we are able to synchronize to ensure that our r.clients map is only ever modified by one thing at a time.
