== Hosted bootstrap to your project code :

    http.Handle("/assets/", http.StripPrefix("/assets",    http.FileServer(http.Dir("/path/to/assets/"))))

    Notice how the http.StripPrefix and http.FileServer functions return objects that satisfy the http.Handler interface as per the decorator pattern that we implement with our MustAuth helper function.


== Getting started with OAuth2
OAuth2 is an open authorization standard designed to allow resource owners to give clients delegated access to private data (such as wall posts or tweets) via an access token exchange handshake. Even if you do not wish to access the private data, OAuth2 is a great option that allows people to sign in using their existing credentials, without exposing those credentials to a third-party site. In this case, we are the third party, and we want to allow our users to sign in using services that support OAuth2.

From a user's point of view, the OAuth2 flow is as follows:

- The user selects the provider with whom they wish to sign in to the client app.
- The user is redirected to the provider's website (with a URL that includes the client app ID) where they are asked to give permission to the client app.
- The user signs in from the OAuth2 service provider and accepts the permissions requested by the third-party application.
- The user is redirected to the client app with a request code.
- In the background, the client app sends the grant code to the provider, who sends back an authentication token.
- The client app uses the access token to make authorized requests to the provider, such as to get user information or wall posts.

To avoid reinventing the wheel, we will look at a few open source projects that have already solved this problem for us.

     we will use gomniauth to access OAuth services provided by Google, Facebook, and GitHub, so make sure you have it installed by running the following command

     go get github.com/stretchr/gomniauth


== Tell the authorization providers about your app

- Before we ask an authorization provider to help our users sign in,
- we must tell them about our application. M
- ost providers have some kind of web tool or console where you can create applications to kick this process off.
- Here's one from Google:

In order to identify the client application, we need to create a client ID and secret. Despite the fact that OAuth2 is an open standard, each provider has their own language and mechanism to set things up. Therefore, you will most likely have to play around with the user interface or the documentation to figure it out in each case.

At the time of writing, in *Google Cloud Console*, you navigate to *API Manager* and click on the *Credentials* section.



1. At Credential select Google ADD API KEY

    AIzaSyBFl-aDBbsmx9lGDwdfFsrVAccSYgrEjiE


2. Add Oauth2 select ouath2
  select web app

3. save the client id and secret

CLient ID

Secret

The *GetBeginAuthURL(nil, nil)* arguments are for the state and options respectively, which we are not going to use for our chat application.

The first argument is a state map of data that is encoded and signed and sent to the authentication provider. The provider doesn't do anything with the state; it just sends it back to our callback endpoint. This is useful if, for example, we want to redirect the user back to the original page they were trying to access before the authentication process intervened. For our purpose, we have only the /chat endpoint, so we don't need to worry about sending any state.

The second argument is a map of additional options that will be sent to the authentication provider, which somehow modifies the behavior of the authentication process. For example, you can specify your own scope parameter, which allows you to make a request for permission to access additional information from the provider. For more information about the available options, search for OAuth2 on the Internet or read the documentation for each provider, as these values differ from service to service.


    We will continue to stop, rebuild, and run our projects manually throughout this book, but there are some tools that will take care of this for you by watching for changes and restarting Go applications automatically. If you're interested in such tools, check out https://github.com/pilu/fresh and https://github.com/codegangsta/gin.

== Chapter 3. Three Ways to Implement Profile Pictures

- What the good practices to get additional information from auth services are, even when there are no standards in place
- When it is appropriate to build abstractions into our code
- How Go's zero-initialization pattern can save time and memory
- How reusing an interface allows us to work with collections and individual objects in the same way as the existing interface did
- How to use the https://en.gravatar.com/ web service
- How to do MD5 hashing in Go
- How to upload files over HTTP and store them on a server
- How to serve static files through a Go web server
- How to use unit tests to guide the refactoring of code
- How and when to abstract functionality from struct types into interfaces


*Cool Stuff*

    r := newRoom(UseAuthAvatar)

Thinking about code readability is important when designing interfaces. Consider a method that takes a Boolean input just passing in true or false hides the real meaning if you don't know the argument names. Consider defining a couple of helper constants, as shown in the following short example:

    func move(animated bool) { /* ... */ }
    const Animate = true const
    DontAnimate = false

Think about which of the following calls to move are easier to understand:

    move(true)
    move(false)
    move(Animate)
    move(DontAnimate)

== Command-Line Tools to Find Domain Names

- How to build complete command-line applications with as little as a single code file
- How to ensure that the tools we build can be composed with other tools using standard streams
- How to interact with a simple third-party JSON RESTful API
- How to utilize the standard in and out pipes in Go code
- How to read from a streaming source, one line at a time
- How to build a WHOIS client to look up domain information
- How to store and use sensitive or deployment-specific information in environment variables


=== Five simple programs

In this chapter, we will build five small programs that we will combine at the end. The key features of the programs are as follows:

- Sprinkle: This program will add some web-friendly sprinkle words to increase the chances of finding the available domain names.
- Domainify: This program will ensure words are acceptable for a domain name by removing unacceptable characters. Once this is done, it will replace spaces with hyphens and add an appropriate top-level domain (such as .com and .net) to the end.
- Coolify: This program will change a boring old normal word to Web 2.0 by fiddling around with vowels.
- Synonyms: This pro will use a third-party API to find synonyms.
- Available: This gram will use a third-party API to find synonyms. Available: This program will check to see whether the domain is available or not using an appropriate WHOIS server.

The preceding script simply builds all our subprograms (including domainfinder, which we are yet to write),
telling go build to place them in our lib folder. Be sure to give execution rights to the new script by doing *chmod +x build.sh* or something similar. Run this script from a terminal and look inside the lib folder to ensure that it has indeed placed the binaries for our subprograms.


== Chapter 5.  Building Distributed Systems and Working with Flexible Data

In this chapter, we will explore transferrable skills that allow us to use schemaless data and distributed technologies to solve big data problems. The system we will build in this chapter will prepare us for a future where all democratic elections happen online on Twitter, of course. Our solution will collect and count votes by querying Twitter's streaming API for mentions of specific hash tags, and each component will be capable of horizontally scaling to meet demand. Our use case is a fun and interesting one, but the core concepts we'll learn and the specific technology choices we'll make are the real focus of this chapter. The ideas discussed here are directly applicable to any system that needs true-scale capabilities.

- Horizontal scaling refers to adding nodes, such as physical machines, to a system in order to improve its availability, performance, and/or capacity. Big data companies such as Google can scale by adding affordable and easy-to-obtain hardware (commonly referred to as commodity hardware) due to the way they write their software and architect their solutions.

- Vertical scaling is synonymous to increasing the resource available to a single node, such as adding additional RAM to a box or a processor with more cores.

    "three": 300
  }
}
----


==== Introducing NSQ

In most cases, services such as mongod and nsqd will have to be started before we can run our programs. Since we are writing components of a distributed system, we will have to run each program at the same time, which is as simple as opening many terminal windows.

NSQ is a messaging queue that allows one program to send messages or events to another or to many other programs running either locally on the same machine or on different nodes connected by a network. NSQ guarantees the delivery of each message at least once, which means that it keeps undelivered messages cached until all interested parties have received them. This means that even if we stop our counter program, we won't miss any votes. You can contrast this capability with fire-and-forget message queues, where information is deemed out of date, and is, therefore, forgotten if it isn't delivered in time and when the sender of the messages doesn't care whether the consumer received them or not.

NSQ transfers raw bytes, which means that it is up to us how we encode data into these bytes. For example, we could encode the data as JSON or in a binary format depending on our needs. In our case, we are going to send the vote option as a string without any additional encoding, since we are only sharing a single data field.


- Open http://nsq.io/deployment/installing.html in a browser (or search install nsq) and follow the instructions for your environment. You can either download precompiled binaries or build your own from the source. If you have homebrew installed, installing NSQ is as simple as typing the following:

    brew install nsq

- Once you have installed NSQ, you will need to add the bin folder to your PATH environment variable so that the tools are available in a terminal.

- To validate that NSQ is properly installed, open a terminal and run *nsqlookupd*; if the program successfully starts, you should see output similar to the following:

    nsqlookupd v0.2.27 (built w/go1.3)
    TCP: listening on [::]:4160
    HTTP: listening on [::]:4161

We are going to use the default ports to interact with NSQ, so take note of the TCP and HTTP ports listed in the output, as we will be referring to them in our code.

- Press Ctrl + C to stop the process for now; we'll start them properly later.

The key tools from the NSQ installation that we are going to use are nsqlookupd and nsqd. The nsqlookupd program is a daemon that manages topology information about the distributed NSQ environment; it keeps track of all the nsqd producers for specific topics and provides interfaces for clients to query such information. The nsqd program is a daemon that does the heavy lifting for NSQ, such as receiving, queuing, and delivering messages from and to interested parties.


==== NSQ driver for Go

    go get github.com/bitly/go-nsq


==== MongoDB driver for Go

    go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2


=== Starting the environment

- Start nsqlookupd so that our nsqd instances are discoverable
- Start nsqd and tell it which nsqlookupd to use
- Start mongod for data services

In a terminal window, run the following:

   nsqlookupd

   nsqd --lookupd-tcp-address=localhost:4160

Make sure the port number in the --lookupd-tcp-address flag matches the TCP port of the nsqlookupd instance. Once you start nsqd, you will notice some output printed to the terminal from both nsqlookupd and nsqd; this indicates that the two processes are talking to each other.

    mongod --dbpath ./db

The dbpath flag tells MongoDB where to store the data files for our database. You can pick any location you like, but you'll have to make sure the folder exists before mongod will run.

By deleting the dbpath folder at any time, you can effectively erase all data and start afresh. This is especially useful during development.


=== Reading votes from Twitter

- Head over to https://apps.twitter.com and create a new app called something like SocialPoll (the names have to be unique, so you can have some fun here; the choice of name doesn't affect the code either way).

====
489pQJ58C71jOBBKmo1ZDRBvWMYjmzzVi7H0m2YKEWtkk
====

=== Extracting the connection

The Twitter streaming API supports HTTP connections that stay open for a long time, and given the design of our solution, we are going to need to access the net.Conn object in order to close it from outside of the goroutine in which requests occur. We can achieve this by providing our own dial method to an http.Transport object that we will create.


=== Testing Twitter Poll

-To make sure our program works, we need to do two things: first, we need to create a poll in the database, and second, we need to peer inside the messaging queue to see whether the messages are indeed being generated by twittervotes.

- In a terminal, run the mongo command to open a database shell that allows us to interact with MongoDB. Then, enter the following commands to add a test poll:

    > use ballots
    switched to db ballots
> db.polls.insert({"title":"Test poll","options":
     ["happy","sad","fail","win"]})

The preceding commands add a new item to the polls collection in the ballots database. We are using some common words for options that are likely to be mentioned by people on Twitter so that we can observe real tweets being translated into messages. You might notice that our poll object is missing the results field; this is fine since we are dealing with unstructured data where documents do not have to adhere to a strict schema. The counter program we are going to write in the next section will add and maintain the results data for us later.

Press Ctrl + C to exit the MongoDB shell and type the following command:

    nsq_tail --topic="votes" --lookupd-http-address=localhost:4160

The nsq_tail tool connects to the specified messaging queue topic and outputs any messages that it notices. This is where we will validate that our twittervotes program is sending messages.

In a separate terminal window, let's build and run the twittervotes program:

    go build -o twittervotes

    ./twittervotes
